# Class D Amplifier PWM Generator Using Arduino

This code can be used to Input audio signals to the Arduino. Then the audio is sampled in 76kHz and generated a PWM waveform of 62.5kHz. 
This generated PWM signal can be used to drive a H-Bridge. For better audio clarity use a low pass filter before the speaker.
